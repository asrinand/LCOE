Levelized Cost of Electricity

This is a very simple calculator that helps in calculating the levelized cost (also known as average cost) of electricity per kWh (Kilowatt hour).

The user has to enter the rated power of the turbine, rotor diameter, average wind speed, capital cost, equity, operation and maintenance cost, and the interest of loan and loan period. It then calculates the levelized cost by computing the capacity factor, capital recovery factor etc and finally shows the levelized/average cost($/kWh) of the electricity for that wind turbine.
